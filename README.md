# go-device42
Go library for accessing the Device42 API.

The general design and implementation (and code as well) of this comes from the [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library from Google.

## Status
There's still a LOT to do. I have a need for this at my current job and I'm sharing it here in hopes that someone else has the same need.

## Can I help?
Of course! I love Pull Requests! I've linked above for how the general design of the library should work and [here](http://api.device42.com/)
are the docs for the Device42 API.
